# Image Segmentation using Bayesian Probability Theory

Simple image segmentation algorithm using probability. Implemented from scratch using Numpy, and a small dataset. The idea was to understand how features play an important role in the classification of images. It was a fun project to do with some dabbling in Python-OpenCV, Scipy, Matplotlib and a lot of Numpy! There was even a fun 2-D matrix traversal problem that had to be solved for the feature extraction!
